### Global Space: 
        Any code we write inside Javascript which is not inside a function is known as global space.
            Eg : 
           -     let a = 10;  // This is a global space

           -     var b = 21;  // This is a global space

           -     function b(){

                }               // This is a global space

            -   function c(){
                let x = 21;     // This 'x' is not a global space beacuse it is under a function.

            }
